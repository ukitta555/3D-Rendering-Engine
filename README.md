# 3D Rendering engine #
Final project for my 10th grade programming course.
Although I get how it works, don't take it way too seriously -  half of the code was copied from different articles / repos.
Moreover, half of the OOP principles are not followed as they should be - gotta rework this stuff when I in mood to.
